abstract: Synthetic biology is a movement to standardize genetic engineering and make
  it more repeatable. An important advancement was the development of standardized
  genetic parts known as BioBricks, which can be composed using restriction enzyme
  assembly. The iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machines) competition is
  an important synthetic biology outreach activity which is run by the iGEM foundation
  in keeping with their principles of the advancement of synthetic biology via education,
  competition, and development of an open and collaborative community. As part of
  the iGEM competition students submit records of any ‘parts’ they create to the iGEM
  registry (http://parts.igem.org/Main_Page). The iGEM registry was converted to the
  Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) data format, a standard language for describing
  genetic designs, and a preliminary analysis of the data was carried out to predict
  the size of a potential library as well as quantify current problems with the registry
  data set.
