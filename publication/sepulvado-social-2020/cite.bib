 abstract = {The Synthetic Biology Knowledge System (SBKS) is a
repository system designed to aid synthetic biologists by interlinking the synthetic biology literature through the application of ontologies. While many of these linking tasks are concerned with DNA/protein sequences, the organisms they are cultivated in, or chemical products of cellular processes, it is equally important to interlink the various ethical
issues that concern the tailoring biological life in the form of bacteria and yeasts for participation in industrial processes to consider. Thus, an additional linking task for the SBKS is to link pertinent bioethics articles to biological entities, processes, and products that are central to the research of synthetic biologists. In this paper, we make a preliminary analysis of the state of the ethical discourse in the burgeoning synthetic biology discipline.},
