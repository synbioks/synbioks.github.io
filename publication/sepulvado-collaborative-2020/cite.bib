 abstract = {Although synthetic biology is now an established field, ethical reflection surrounding it has only recently become a subject of sustained scientific inquiry. This poster displays the results from a series of network analyses examining how synthetic biology ethics is evolving. The studies gather ethics articles from 802 institutions and 2,179 authors and suggest that the fields' social structure has become democratized at the individual level but remains dominated by a handful of institutions at the organizational level.},
