 abstract = {Synthetic biologists often use diagrams to visualize the structure and functionality of genetic designs due to their complicated nature. The Synthetic Biology Open Language Visual (SBOLv) is a standard for these diagrams. This standard provides a set of glyphs for synthetic biology components and how they can interact. These visual designs also have a complementary data standard, the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL), which represents the structural and functional information for genetic designs
This paper describes SBOLCanvas, an updated web-based genetic design editor that can create visual diagrams using all features of SBOLv2.},
