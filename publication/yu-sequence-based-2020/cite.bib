 abstract = {With the massive growth of community designed parts, opensource repositories such as SynBioHub [2] have become increasingly popular among synthetic biologists as a convenient way to store and share their genetic designs online. However, the sheer size of such repositories make it difficult to simply browse for the desired parts. The reference instance https://synbiohub.org) contains over 100,000 publicly
available parts in its repository, not counting the various private repositories added by users. Currently, users can only find a part based on a keyword in the partâ€™s description, or through various filters such as date of creation, creator, or collection. However, prior to this work, it was not possible in SynBioHub to search for similar sequences.},
