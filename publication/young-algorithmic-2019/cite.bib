 abstract = {This talk will discuss early application of linear regression models to optimize combinatorial libraries of
biosynthetic pathways and how this frames the future of AI in synthetic biology. Through a discussion of
several biological systems constructed in yeast, we will show how heterologous pathway engineering
lends itself to machine learning to predict desired enzyme expression levels for optimal function. We will
then show how we are working to include host modifications within this framework. In the course of
expanding the number of variables in algorithmic optimization workflows, we have begun to encounter
limits in biological quantitation. Current methods for obtaining biological information are practically datapoor for machine learning and much of the information is aggregated by experts over the corpus of
literature. Therefore, there is motivation to construct searchable databases and conduct literature mining
to assemble all the information necessary to initiate and modify a design. Thus, we argue that supporting
the genetic designer is a grand challenge facing those who wish to continue to find new applications for
AI in synthetic biology.},
